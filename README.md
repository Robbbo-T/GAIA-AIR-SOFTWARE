# GAIA AIR SOFTWARE

## Project Description

The GAIA AIR initiative is part of the GAIA DS (Sustainable Development) division. The project aims to design and document a comprehensive ecosystem of intelligent and sustainable aircraft.

The renewed contract between Capgemini and Airbus consolidates a long-standing collaboration in the production of technical maintenance documentation for commercial aviation. Capgemini, including its division Capgemini Engineering (formerly Altran), supports Airbus's SID (Customer Services – Technical Data Systems) department in the creation and updating of technical maintenance manuals for Airbus's main commercial aircraft families.

## Objectives

- Optimize the operation through artificial intelligence (autonomous navigation, route planning, predictive maintenance).
- Accelerate energy and trajectory decision-making with quantum computing algorithms.
- Ensure traceability and security of design, flight, and maintenance data through blockchain.
- Facilitate semantic interoperability and reduce cognitive load for engineers and operators with standardized data specifications.

## Importance

- Aviation is responsible for around 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions and over 4% of its climate forcing when non-CO₂ effects are included.
- GAIA AIR proposes a design framework, advanced materials (CFRP, lightweight alloys, TPS), efficient propulsion systems (high-bypass turbofans, cryogenic rockets), and a federated digital infrastructure aimed at minimizing environmental footprint, increasing operational resilience, and democratizing aeronautical innovation in terms of sustainability.

## GAIA AIR Initiative

The GAIA AIR initiative is a comprehensive effort to create an ecosystem of intelligent and sustainable aircraft. The initiative includes the following key components:

- **AI-Assisted Design**: Modules for designing aircraft with the help of artificial intelligence.
- **Quantum Simulations**: Tools for simulating various aspects of aircraft operation using quantum computing.
- **Technical Documentation**: Tools for creating and maintaining technical documentation in compliance with COAFI and AMEDEO standards.

## Relevant Repositories and Resources

- [GAIA-AIR](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/GAIA-AIR.git): The main repository for the GAIA AIR initiative.
