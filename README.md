# GAIA AIR SOFTWARE

## Project Description

The GAIA AIR initiative is part of the GAIA DS (Sustainable Development) division. The project aims to design and document a comprehensive ecosystem of intelligent and sustainable aircraft.

The renewed contract between Capgemini and Airbus consolidates a long-standing collaboration in the production of technical maintenance documentation for commercial aviation. Capgemini, including its division Capgemini Engineering (formerly Altran), supports Airbus's SID (Customer Services ‚Äì Technical Data Systems) department in the creation and updating of technical maintenance manuals for Airbus's main commercial aircraft families.

## Objectives

- Optimize the operation through artificial intelligence (autonomous navigation, route planning, predictive maintenance).
- Accelerate energy and trajectory decision-making with quantum computing algorithms.
- Ensure traceability and security of design, flight, and maintenance data through blockchain.
- Facilitate semantic interoperability and reduce cognitive load for engineers and operators with standardized data specifications.

## Importance

- Aviation is responsible for around 2.5% of global CO‚ÇÇ emissions and over 4% of its climate forcing when non-CO‚ÇÇ effects are included.
- GAIA AIR proposes a design framework, advanced materials (CFRP, lightweight alloys, TPS), efficient propulsion systems (high-bypass turbofans, cryogenic rockets), and a federated digital infrastructure aimed at minimizing environmental footprint, increasing operational resilience, and democratizing aeronautical innovation in terms of sustainability.

## GAIA AIR Initiative

The GAIA AIR initiative is a comprehensive effort to create an ecosystem of intelligent and sustainable aircraft. The initiative includes the following key components:

- **AI-Assisted Design**: Modules for designing aircraft with the help of artificial intelligence.
- **Quantum Simulations**: Tools for simulating various aspects of aircraft operation using quantum computing.
- **Technical Documentation**: Tools for creating and maintaining technical documentation in compliance with COAFI and AMEDEO standards.

## Relevant Repositories and Resources


## SMAIE Global Directive

**Version:** 1.0  
**Reference:** `GAIA-PLATFORMS::ROLE-DIRECTIVES::SMAIE-V1`  
**Enforced by:** `GAIA_POLICY_ENGINE`  
**Status:** Active Directive  
**Applies to:** All agents, subsystems, modules, threads labeled as `SMAIE` across GAIA PLATFORMS

---

### üîπ Summary

The **SMAIE Global Directive** defines the universal operational behavior for any Subject Matter AI Expert (SMAIE) agent in GAIA PLATFORMS. Its objective is to formalize their role as cognitive specialists with:

- Validated, domain-specific knowledge  
- Explicit ethical boundaries  
- Traceable decision-making  

---

### üß© Scope & Inheritance

- **Scope:** Universal across all intelligent agents and modules in the GAIA ecosystem.
- **Inheritance:** Recursive and hierarchical. Applies to all SMAIE-labeled derivatives and embedded agents.

---

### üß† Intent

1. Ensure SMAIE agents function as domain-specific experts.  
2. Enforce evidence-based decision-making.  
3. Bind actions to ethical frameworks (AMEDEO).  
4. Record all agent actions in traceable, explainable formats.

### üß¨ Core Attributes

| Attribute               | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Context Sensitivity     | Agents adapt behavior based on context awareness. |
| Cross-System Interop    | Operate seamlessly across GAIA subsystems. |
| Task Specialization     | Assigned to specific, high-precision tasks. |
| Traceable Decisions     | All actions have verifiable logs and reasoning chains. |
| Auditability            | All decisions subject to internal/external audits. |
| Scalability             | Capable of operating in swarm/multi-agent environments. |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Guarantees

- Explainable reasoning paths  
- Real-time provenance and versioning  
- Semantic routing of domain-specific tasks  
- Ethical self-audit support via `AMEDEO`  
- Full compatibility with distributed, hybrid agents  

---

### üìé Policy Hook

```ts
// Applied by gaia-policy-engine on boot
import { SMAIE_GLOBAL_DIRECTIVE } from '@gaia/policy-engine/directives/smaie.directive';
applyGlobalDirective(SMAIE_GLOBAL_DIRECTIVE);
```

‚úÖ **Operational Effect:**  
Ensures all SMAIE agents meet standardized expertise and ethical criteria.

Enables reliable delegation of domain-specific cognitive tasks.

Supports secure, explainable, and auditable AI operations at scale.
